An image search GUI application written using Tk, matplotlib and the google image 
search API.

The Solution is written in the ipython notebook "image_gui.ipynb".

To run the application run all cells following the section labeled "GUI Application".

The GUI has a search bar for entering search terms. Upon hitting the "search" button,
the application determines the first image returned by the google image search API,
displaying the source url and the image itself. Dummy buttons provide the layout
for where additional options would be ( I didn't have time to implement the image
manipulations). Finally a quit button is provided to gracefully close the window.
The image is saved to a new file 'dl_image.jpg'.
